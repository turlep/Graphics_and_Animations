### The Game Project ###

#### Week 2 part a â€“ Game character ####

Use p5 drawing functions such as rect, ellipse, line, triangle and
point to draw the different states of your game character.

Write the code so that your character appears inside the box for each
state.

Each state is worth two marks:

0 marks = not a reasonable attempt  
1 mark = attempted but it's messy or lacks detail  
2 marks = you've used lots of shape functions to create a detailed
game character

** Only submit your sketch.js **
