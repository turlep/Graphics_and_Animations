# Noise_Terrain

https://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/~pturl001/generative_drawing/cw3_noiseTerrain/

Here is a noise generated landscape, with colour changes according to height with pools of water at the low points to mimic terrain. My aim was to try show 2D and 3D noise simultaneously while creating something meaningful, that exists in the real world.
